### Min even number


The function searches for the minimum even number in the array. If there is no such thing, it returns -1.

#### How it works:

Immediately writes the number -1 to the result variable.
Then in the loop we check that the current number is even and the second adjacent condition - it is less than the number in the result variable or we have the value -1 in the result variable (the first entry in the result variable)
