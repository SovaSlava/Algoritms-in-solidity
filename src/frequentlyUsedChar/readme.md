### The most frequenly used char in string (array of strings in our case)

There are 2 functions: one use storage, but the other is only memory.

Functions return 2 variables: char and number of times a symbol appears.


How it works:

In for loop and store in mapping char with currentCount + 1. After that, we check, if count of current char is greater than maxCount, if yes, we update maxCount and maxChar.
